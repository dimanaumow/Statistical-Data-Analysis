# Statistical Data Analysis Course Labs

This repository serves as a directory to all the laboratory works I've completed for the Statistical Data Analysis course at [University Name]. Each lab focuses on different aspects of statistical analysis using the R programming language.

## Course Information

- **Institution**: [University of Warsaw]
- **Course**: Statistical Data Analysis
- **Term**: [Spring 2024]
- **Instructors**: [Błażej Miasojedow, Barbara Domżał, Szymon Nowakowski]

## Labs Overview

Below is a list of laboratory works, each contained within its own repository, along with a brief description of the topics covered and the main objectives.

### Lab 1: First Statistical Report

- **Repository**: [Click to see](https://github.com/dimanaumow/Lab1-First-Statistical-Report)

- **Description**: This lab serves as an introduction to creating comprehensive statistical reports. It focuses on the fundamental 
skills required to process, analyze, and present data in a clear and informative manner using R. 
The objective is to guide students through the complete process of statistical analysis — from data collection to the final presentation of results.

- **Topics Covered**:
  - **Data Collection and Preparation**: Introduction to data collection methods, data cleaning, and preparation techniques.
  - **Descriptive Statistics**: Computing and interpreting measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation, range).
  - **Data Visualization**: Creating effective visual representations of data, including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.
  - **Report Writing**: Structuring and writing a statistical report. Emphasis on how to present statistical findings clearly and effectively.
  - **R Markdown**: Introduction to R Markdown for creating dynamic analysis reports that combine code, output, and narrative text.

- **Key R Packages**: `ggplot2` for data visualization, `knitr` and `rmarkdown` for report generation.

- **Learning Outcomes**:
  - Acquire the skills to clean and prepare data for analysis.
  - Understand and apply basic descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques.
  - Develop the ability to communicate statistical findings through comprehensive reports.
  - Learn to use R Markdown to create reproducible statistical reports that integrate R code, results, and analysis narrative.
- **Challenges Encountered**: Discussion of any challenges encountered during the data analysis and report writing process, and how they were addressed.



### Lab 2: Parameter Estimation

- **Repository**: [Click to see](https://github.com/dimanaumow/Lab-2-Parameter-Estimation)

- **Description**: This laboratory work focuses on the fundamental concepts and techniques of parameter estimation in statistical analysis. 
The main objectives include understanding the principles of point estimation and interval estimation, 
implementing various estimation methods using the R programming language, 
and applying these methods to real-world datasets to estimate population parameters based on sample data.

- **Topics Covered**:
  - Introduction to parameter estimation: Understanding the difference between point estimates and interval estimates.
  - Methods of estimation: Exploring different estimation methods, including Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Method of Moments, and Bayesian Estimation.
  - Confidence intervals: Calculating confidence intervals for population means, proportions, and variances.
  - Application to real-world data: Using R to apply estimation methods to datasets to infer about population parameters.


- **Learning Outcomes**:
  - Gain a solid understanding of the theoretical foundations of parameter estimation.
  - Develop practical skills in applying estimation techniques to analyze data using R.
  - Learn how to interpret the results of parameter estimation in the context of data analysis
